# Programming as theory building

I believe programming is best viewed as theory building and symmanthesy.
I use "theory" interchangably with "explanation", I view good theories as good explanations.

- *Programming as theory building*, Naur 1985: https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf
- Software design as good explanations, Tellman 2024: https://explaining.software/archive/a-brief-introduction/
- Building good explanations in a team, Kerr, 2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEQj7fy-Htg

I suggest viewing programming as practice and theory.
Practice: it needs to do the thing it should do. It *works*.
Theory: in order to be possible to work with it over time, it must *make sense*.

As a beginner programmer, aim for those to.

- Your program should do the right thing
- And your program should make sense.
