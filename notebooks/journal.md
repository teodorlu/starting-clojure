# Starting Clojure - Journal

## 2024-12-31

### Why

I believe that the beginner's journey for programmers getting used to Clojure could be improved drastically, and I want to help make that happen.
Getting in touch with great Clojure programmers works great, and has worked great before.
But what if a beginner neither knows where to start, or has access to great Clojure programmers?
That's where I want to focus.

Eric Normand frames this in a nice way on his newsletter:

> I was on the latest episode of defn. We talked about the Clojure community. I
> have a cautiously optimistic take. However, there is one thing I’d like to
> expand on, which I didn’t explain within the context of the conversation, but
> (with hindsight) I should probably expand on.
>
> I never wished to discourage anyone from the Scicloj community. It’s a great
> group of folks and they are doing amazing and important work into scientific
> computing resources for the Clojure ecosystem. Everything I said on the
> podcast was the truth: I did try some of the libraries and I did get stuck. I
> think that speaks more to myself than to the libraries. I wasn’t motivated to
> work through the learning curve, and I’m bad at reaching out for help. I would
> rather read docs than open up a chat.

I believe this also applies to gettings started with Clojure programmering in general.

### Approach: collect experiences and resources, then synthesize

Use this repo as a ground for collection and synthesis.
Zero treshold to add stuff, then synthesize later.

Target _beginners_.
This site will not get you from advanced to expert.

Beginners means:

1. Those who have never programmed before are welcome
2. Those who have programmed in other languages before are welcome
3. Those who have some Clojure experience are welcome
4. Those who want to help are welcome.

The _main_ target audience are those who are not yet comfortable in Clojure, and would reach for no language or a different language for solving their problems.

### Clojure Camp

I believe the most exciting initative aimed to help people get started with Clojure is Clojure Camp: https://clojure.camp/

Just working with Clojure Camp may be the best way to reach the goal of a beginner friendly Clojure introduction.
A possible point of contention is whether physical engagement is required.
Online communities tend to rely on interpersonal relationships, and writing for _everyone_ may require a different frame.

### A starting point: perspectives from people

Here are some people whose perspectives I'd like to get:

0. Mitesh Shah - rewatch *Beyond the Hype: Obstacles on the Path to Clojure Adoption* from  Heart of Clojure and come up with some questions.
   https://2024.heartofclojure.eu/talks/beyond-the-hype-obstacles-on-the-path-to-clojure-adoption/
1. Mathias - how was the getting started experience?
2. Sigmund - when did he get started, and how?
3. Olav - what has his experience with Clojure been, and where are the pain points?
4. Rafael Dittwald - experiences with Clojure camp and thoughts about teaching beginners in general
5. Sean Corfield - what he considers most important for beginners to get right, and what he believes is missing
6. Safet - great guy, recognizes "sexyness" in languages, should be able to answer "is Clojure perceived to be sexy?"
7. Lars Tveito - are his students getting interested in Clojure?
8. Leif Eric - his experience, and his thoughts
9. Magnar and Christian - TODO shape questions.

### Questions

- **What should the emphasis be for the first day?** The first week? The first month?
  I did a quick writeup on https://play.teod.eu/clojure-survival-kit/ (august 2023), that may require some revision.

- **How do beginners evaluate the language compared to other options? Are we selling it well?**

### Initiatives

- Collect resources and lessons here - in the form of markdown or Clerk notebooks.

- Talk to people about the getting started experience, write down summaries or record.
